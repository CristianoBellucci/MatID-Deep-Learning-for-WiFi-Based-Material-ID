# MatID-Deep-Learning-for-WiFi-Based-Material-ID
My thesis project. MatID uses WiFi signals for material identification via deep learning. It integrates classical signal processing with 2D/1D CNNs and ResNet18 models. In addition, offers a privacy-preserving, cost-effective alternative to visual-based methods, enhancing WiFi sensing applications.
